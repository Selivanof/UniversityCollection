## Description
The projects was given in multiple assignments, gradually creating a functional battleship game, with a simple "smartplayer" that can play the game. I was mainly responsible for the development of the smartplayer, while also leading the team during the rest of the development.

## Notes
The project received a +1.0 bonus for placing first in the SmartPlayer Tournament that was held at the end of the semester.
