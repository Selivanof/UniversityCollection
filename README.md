# Collection of University Projects/Assignments
This repository is a collection of projects and assignments that I completed during my undergraduate studies at the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 

Any files related to those projects are not contained in this repo, but can instead be found in each course's separate repository. Links to those repos are included in this file.
