# Collection of University Projects/Assignments
This repository is a collection of projects and assignments that I completed during my undergraduate studies at the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 

Any files related to those projects are not contained in this repo, but can instead be found in each course's separate repository. Links to those repos are included in this file.

## Year 5 (2024-2025)

Hello from the future

### Project Grading (and Types) Explained
- **Additive**
  - The project's grade is simply added to the exam's final grade. Any increase beyond the exam's maximum possible grade is ignored.
  - Such projects are always optional with no penalty for not turning them in.
- **Fixed Percentage**
  - The final grade is calculated by the formula `Project * XX% + Exam * (100 - XX)%`, where both Project and Exam grades are on a scale /10.
  - If the project is optional, not turning it in is equivalent to a project graded as 0. If the project is mandatory, a minimum grade (usually 5/10) must be achieved.
- **Boosting Percentage**
  - Same as Raw Percentage, but the Project's grade contributes to the final grade ONLY if only if it improves the final grade. Otherwise, XX% = 0% and the final grade is the same as the Exam's grade.
  - Such projects are always optional with no penalty for not turning them in.
